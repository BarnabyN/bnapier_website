This repo will contain a personal website/blog that I plan on creating during the UK's coronavirus lockdown.

Programmed in React, the plan is to have a frontend site where the user can view all the posts, as well as a platform for uploading new posts onto the site without having to write in a code editor (for example, uploading .docx files instead).

# TODO

## Add ckeditor5 functionality for:

- Images
- Mathematical formulae
- Code snippets
