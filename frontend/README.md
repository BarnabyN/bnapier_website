This repo will contain a personal website/blog that I plan on creating during the UK's coronavirus lockdown.

Programmed in React, the plan is to have a frontend site where the user can view all the posts, as well as a platform for uploading new posts onto the site without having to write in a code editor (for example, uploading .docx files instead).

# Main Pages

- **Blog:** Where I write my main articles
- **Ideas:** Thoughts and ideas of things in the world that could be done better or are not being done
- **Problems:** Problems and thought experiments that may or may not have a closed form solution
- **About:** A shameless excuse to talk about myself
